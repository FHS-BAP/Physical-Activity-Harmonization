# Physical-Activity-Harmonization

These program scripts will generate derived variables related to physical activity information. 
The format of these datasets is of wide format, with distinct variable names that allow users to tell the difference for repeated measurements of data of similar nature.
The naming convention of these variables aligned for that of the FHS-BAP curated datasets: https://github.com/FHS-BAP/Curated-Datasets 

Please ensure you have the listed datasets meantioned in the script header to run the codes optimally.

IMPORTANT: Due to consent restrictions, the counts you see on the manuals may differ based on the source you obtained the FHS datasets from.
